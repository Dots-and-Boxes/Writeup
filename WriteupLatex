\section*{Choice of game}
\begin{flushleft}

We chose the game Dots and Boxes because: \newline
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It fulfils the criteria for a combinatorial game.
    \item It is relatively simple to learn and play.
    \item It seems fairly interesting to play.
\end{enumerate}

\end{flushleft}

\section*{Program type}

We are going to begin with a player, that is a program that can make legal moves.
We will try to improve upon the code and algorithm to reach the level of a solver eventually.

\section*{Division of work}
We anticipate that about 70 percent of the code will be written by us explicitly. The rest will likely be taken from the Internet. \newline

The work will be divided as such:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item One person to build the user interface
    \item Two people to conceive the algorithm
    \item One person to build the actual program
\end{enumerate}
